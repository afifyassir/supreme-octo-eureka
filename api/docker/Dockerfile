# Creates a directory /opt/app in the container’s filesystem to store the application code.
# /opt is a standard directory on Unix and Linux systems where third-party application software is
# typically installed. Inside /opt, the app subdirectory is a common naming convention used to indicate
# that this directory will contain the application code and related files.
RUN mkdir -p /opt/app

# The next RUN command is a series of commands connected with && to reduce the number of layers in the image.
# apt-get update -y: Updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.
# apt-get install -y make: Installs the make utility, which is used to control the generation of executables
# and other non-source files of a program from the program’s source files.
# The make utility is an essential tool for managing the build process of software. It uses  \
# a file called a Makefile that contains a set of directives used by the make command to build \
# and manage the non-source files of a program (such as files generated by Alembic or Tox)
# apt-get install -y libffi-dev gcc: Installs the libffi development files and the GNU Compiler Collection
# (gcc). libffi is often used for calling C functions from within Python, and gcc is used for compiling
# C extensions for Python. A C extension in Python is a module written in the C programming language that
# can be imported into Python just like a regular Python module.
# apt-get install -y curl: Installs curl, a tool for transferring data with URLs, which is useful for
# testing APIs.
# apt-get install -y libpq-dev: Installs the development files for the PostgreSQL database, which are
# necessary to compile the psycopg2 package, a PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
# The command apt-get is used in Debian-based Linux operating systems, such as Ubuntu.
